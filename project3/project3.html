        <h2><u>MyNextLvl Project Topic</u></h2>
        <p> The goal of this project is to use a few different persona's and possible scenarios of potential real world users to speculate on how they would behave on the MyNextLvl website to identify any design flaws for possible negative user experience to create a better website.
            <br> <br> Stakeholders:
            <br> - Providers
            <br> - Parents
            <br> - Users of the application (12-21 with chronic conditions)
            <br> - Product Owner
            <br> - Health Department in DeKalb County
            <br> <br>User Groups:
            <br> - 12-17 Year Old Users (Madeline)
            <br> - 18-21 Year Old Users (Johnny)
            <br> - Parents (Deanna)
        </p>

        <h2> <u> Persona's Created</u></h2>
        <p> <br> <b>Madeline Miller </b> Age: 13
<br>       <img src="Maddy.jpg" alt="Maddy Img" height="500px" width="400px">
<br> Bio: Madeline is a 13-year-old female who has been diagnosed with asthma. Since Maddy is under 18 years old she will need her parents’ verification to create an account on MyNextLvl. She and her parents may create an account together. She gets irritated when she forgets she must miss school to go see the doctor, so her parents want to give her a way to get reminders. She also wants to learn more about asthma and why she needs an inhaler and learn about her body’s limitations when she plays outside.
<br>   Madeline's Goals:
<br> - Get help setting up an account from a parent.
<br> - Learn more about her asthma condition and physical limitations.
<br> - Use the website to set reminders for doctor appointments.
