    <h2>Script: Setup</h2>
 <p><strong>Objective:</strong> <br>
    From this interview I hope to obtain information about the client website titled MyNextLvl. This interview process will help me become familiar with the clients and their goals for the website as well as creating a great user experience for this website. I would like to understand the main function of the website, who the target audience is, and the intended goals for the users.</p>
     <p> <strong>Conducting Interview:</strong> <br>
        The interview would be conducted in a face-to-face setting, in person or a Zoom call meeting. Being able to see the client’s reactions and expressions during the conversation will help get a better read on their questions and concerns on any issues that may arise from the project. Face to face interviews also help create a more personal experience.</p>
        <p> <strong>Equipment:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Electronic devices with video/audio capability: Laptop, Camera, Microphone, Chargers/Batteries</li>
            <li>Consent form to record interview</li>
            <li>Set location or Zoom application if Zoom meeting is chosen over in person.</li>
            <li>High-speed Internet access</li>
            <li>Note-taking tools or extra person for note taking</li>
        </ul>  

    <h2>Script: Intro & Participant Background</h2>
<p> "Good morning/evening/afternoon, This is [ name ] with [ company ], how are you doing today?" [respond to answer] "So today I will have a few questions about your "MyNextLvl" project we will be collaborating on to further understand the needs and requirements to make your vision come true and create a positive user experience. Some of the topics we will be going over today includes user interface, which is what the user can see and interact with when using the website and any restrictions that may need to be put in place for users." </p>
    <h2>Script: Main Interview Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>What inspired you to create "MyNextLvl"?</li>
        <li>Who is your target audience and what are their needs and expectations?</li>
        <li>What is the main goal you have in mind for your website?</li>
        <li>Will you need any ongoing maintenance or support for the website or web application?</li>
        <li>Do you need a mobile responsive website?</li>
        <li>Does this website require a database structure?</li>
        <li>Are there any special features you would like to incorporate in the design?</li>
        <li>Will you require any integrations with third-party tools or platforms?</li>
        <li>Will there be any restrictions for the website?</li>
        <li>Do you have any existing websites that you like and would like to use as inspirational models for your own website?</li>
        <li>Can you think of any functions on an existing website that are enjoyable to you?</li>
        <li>Can you think of any functions on an existing website that is frustrating to you?</li>
        <li>Have you already purchased a domain name and web hosting? If not, do you need assistance with this?</li>
        <li>What is the ideal timeline for this project?</li>
        <li>Is there any additional information you would like to discuss or any further questions you may have for us?</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Script: In Closing</h2>

<p>"Thank you so much for taking the time with me today to discuss our project. Your input and feedback is greatly appreciated in this collaboration. I will begin working on a prototype and we can schedule a follow up meeting to check in on the progress and any changes that need to be made. You are always welcome to call or e-mail me with additional information or any questions you may have." </p>

<h2>Example Video Reflection:</h2>
<p>After watching the video, I found that it is important to listen carefully to the client and be prepared for any follow up questions they may ask. A few questions asked in the video should be known by the company creating the website, such as protecting the user’s private information. Interviews can be difficult; I have only ever personally participated in job interviews and this type of project-based interview seems more relaxed with no need to be nervous.</p>
